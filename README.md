Project Task: Face Position Validator in React

Objective:
Create a React application that validates whether a person is sitting properly in front of the webcam with their facial traits clearly visible. If the person is positioned correctly, route the user to the home page of the application.

Guideline:
1. It is a front end based project and therefore backend is required to be made separately. 
2. You can use Opensource Api's for the completion of the task.
3. If you are a fullstack developer and want to create the your backend for it then you can proceed with that.
4. The app should be based upon dynamic resolution.
